    <h2>Home</h2>
    

<p>Welcome to my website. This is primarily intended for personal use but if any of the information I post on here helps someone else that&rsquo;s great.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>A little bit about me. My name is Kameron Ingrando and I&rsquo;m currently a Senior Network Engineer in the DFW Area where I focus on Automation and NetDevOps.</p>

<p>I have over 7 years of experience in the industry and have worked with a wide variety of technologies: {Cisco: [ASA, Catalyst, Firepower, Identity Services Engine, Meraki, WLC], Juniper: [EX, MX, QFX], Random: [Ansible, Ekahau, Linux, Python, Wireshark]}.</p>

<p>Outside of networking, I&rsquo;ve been exploring programming more, specfically web apps, and looking at monitoring, SRE, Docker, and whatever else I discover/feel like looking at.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this-site">What is this site?</h2>

<p>This site&rsquo;s foundantion is based on the note-taking methodology called Zettelkasten used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann">German sociologist Niklas Luhmann</a>. Zettelkasten is a note-taking/knowledge management system that helps you to link notes together to form a web of information. Think of it like the neurons in your brain. Each neuron is connected to other neurons and so on. More information about Zettelkasten can be found <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">here</a></p>

<p>This site is broken down into 4 sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Posts</strong> - These are blog posts that I&rsquo;ve written that more concisely written than my Zettels. These are focused almost exclusively on IT.</li>
<li><strong>Zettels</strong> - These are the collection of Zettels, or notes, that act as a brain dump of information from things I read, watch, or think about. These have no focus and will be about books, videos, papers, or whatever.</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong> - This section is a list of tags used for connecting Zettels together.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> - This is a curated list of content that I find interesting and I want to keep track of outside of the traditional bookmarking/web clipping systems.</li>
</ul>
