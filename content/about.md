## Myself

Welcome to my site. My name is Kameron Ingrando. I am a Senior Network Engineer with over 7 years of industry experience primarily with networking and network security.

I'm currently focused on Juniper, NetDevOps, and Python. However, I have experience in the majority of Cisco's Enterprise platforms including ASA, Catalyst, Firepower, ISE, and Meraki.

## This Site

This site primarily acts as a repository of notes and thoughts that I have on pretty much anything that interests me. I've taken inspiration from the [Digital Garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) and [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) communities. I have a lot of notes in my backlog that I'd like to process and put on here but that will only happen as I have time.

I've broken my site down into 3 sections:

* **Posts**: Formal articles that focus on the technologies I'm working with on a day-to-day basis or have an interest in.
* **Notes**: Scratch notes and thoughts for anything I'm currently studying, have a thought about, or want to remember.
* **Useful Links**: Any useful blog posts, cheatsheets, videos, or websites I find.
