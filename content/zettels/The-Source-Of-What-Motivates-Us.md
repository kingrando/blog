Research has shown that the striatum, which is a part of the basal ganglia, is heavily involved in our motivation system. When something happens to this part of the brain, we seem to become apathetic and generally will not do anything unless explicitly asked to do something. This portion of the brain is what influences our self-motivation.

We are able to get better at self-motivation through practice. The key is to realize we have control over our actions. Giving people a sense of control is the first step in creating drive for that individual. If someone is given a choice, they are more likely to act regardless of what the choices are. 

Asking yourself "why are you doing something?" allows us to push our self and make what we are doing meaningful. Why are you getting up in the morning? Why are you exercising or eating healthy?
