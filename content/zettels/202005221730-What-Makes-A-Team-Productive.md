### Key Takeaways
  * Psychological safety is one of the most important, if not most important, characteristics required for a team to excel.
  * Every team member should have an equal opportunity to speak.
  * Every team member should be able to determine how other people are feeling.

### Notes
Duhigg argues that for a team to really mesh and be outstanding there must be psychological safety. If team members feel comfortable taking changes and speaking up then more risks will be taken. 

[Woolley et al.](http://www.chabris.com/Woolley2010a.pdf) found that it's not a team made up of superstars and intelligent members that makes a good team. Instead all good teams that were studied had two traits. Trait 1: Every team member had equal opportunity to speak and share their ideas. Trait 2: All team members were skilled at being able to determine how others felt, they had "high social sensitivity".

Teams succeed when every member feels like they can speak and feel as though other members can show they are sensitive to how they fee. 

Project Oxygen found that a good manager:

  1. is a good coach
  2. empowers and does not micromanage
  3. expresses interest and concern in subordinatesâ€™ success and well-being
  4. is results oriented
  5. listens and shares information
  6. helps with career development
  7. has a clear vision and strategy
  8. has key technical skills
