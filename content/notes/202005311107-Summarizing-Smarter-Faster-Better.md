## Notes
The following outlines the "how-to" found in the Appendix of Smarter Faster Better by Charles Duhigg.
  * To Generate Motivation
    * "Make a choice that puts you in control."
    * "Figure out how this task is connected to something you care about."
  * To Set Goals:
    * "Choose a stretch goal: an ambition that reflects your biggest aspirations."
    * "Then, break that into subgoals and develop SMART objectives."
  * To Stay Focused:
    * "Envision what will happen. What will occur first? What are potential obstacles? How will you preempt them?"
  * To Make Better Decisions:
    * "Envision multiple futures. By pushing yourself to imagine various possibilities—some of which might be contradictory—you’re better equipped to make wise choices."
    * "We can hone our Bayesian instincts by seeking out different experiences, perspectives, and other people’s ideas."
  * To Make Teams More Effective:
    * "Manage the how, not the who of teams. Psychological safety emerges when everyone feels like they can speak in roughly equal measure and when teammates show they are sensitive to how each other feel."
    * "If you are leading a team, think about the message your choices reveal."
  * To Manage Others Productively:
    * "Lean and agile management techniques tell us employees work smarter and better when they believe they have more decisionmaking authority and when they believe their colleagues are committed to their success."
    * "By pushing decision making to whoever is closest to a problem, managers take advantage of everyone’s expertise and unlock innovation."
    * "A sense of control can fuel motivation, but for that drive to produce insights and solutions, people need to know their suggestions won’t be ignored and that their mistakes won’t be held against them."
  * To Encourage Innovation:
    * "Creativity often emerges by combining old ideas in new ways..."
    * "Be sensitive to your own experiences."
    * "Recognize that the stress that emerges amid the creative process isn’t a sign everything is falling apart."
    * "By forcing ourselves to critique what we’ve already done, by making ourselves look at it from different perspectives, by giving new authority to someone who didn’t have it before, we retain clear eyes."
  * To Absorb Data Better:
    * "When we encounter new information, we should force ourselves to do something with it."
