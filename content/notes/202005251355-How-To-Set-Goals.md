* Stretch Goals: Goals that do not seem possible but what you want to achieve.
* Combine SMART and Stretch goals to reach your goals. Break your stretch goals down using the SMART goals process.

## Notes

GE had developed the concepts of SMART goals between the 1940s and 1980s. This is considered to be one of the primary reasons that GE was so successful during this period.

SMART Goals involve people setting goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and set on a Timeline. The reason they work so well is that they require the person to move abstract goals to concrete plans and then gives the person a way to work towards reaching their goals. However, SMART goals aren't without their faults. Sometimes people will not set the appropriate goals and instead focus on inconsequential goals just to get the psychological satisfaction and closure of completing a goal.

To help with this, it's also good to set stretch goals. Something that seems out of reach and requires the person to come up with new and inventive ways to reach the goal. The Japanese bullet trains were developed this way. At the time trains were not able to go above 65mph but once the engineers were not given a choice and instead were told they had to get a train to 120mph they figured out a way to do it. Instead of doing the easy goal of 70 mph, they had to go outside their comfort zone to get the trains to 120 mph.

Figure out what your stretch and most ambitious goals are and then break those down using SMART goals to achieve them.
