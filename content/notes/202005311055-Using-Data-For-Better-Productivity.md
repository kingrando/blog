## Key Takeaways
  * We can make better decisions the more information but there is a point where there is too much information and we start making bad decisions or not making them at all.
  * We need to try and break problems down into smaller and smaller pieces. 
  * We need to be able to offset the emotions and biases from our own experiences in order to evaluate or lives objectively and make better decisions.

## Notes
There is a tipping point in humans whereas we receive more data we can make better decisions but once we reach that tipping point, our brain shuts down and we start either making bad decisions or not making decisions at all. 

We use a process called “winnowing” or “scaffolding” where we break information down into smaller and smaller pieces. This process gives us the ability to process large amounts of data quickly. We will say “Do we want Italian or Mexican food? Italian. Pizza or Pasta? Pizza. Slow or fast? Fast, etc… until we get to our decision.

Duhigg introduces the Engineering Design Process which states that most problems can be solved if we break them down into smaller and smaller pieces. It’s basic outline is:

  1.	Define the Dilemma
  2.	Collect Data
  3.	Brainstorm Solutions
  4.	Debate Approaches
  5.	Experiment
  6.	Repeat

We need to be able to offset the emotions and biases from our own experiences in order to evaluate or lives objectively and make better decisions.
