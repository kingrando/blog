## Key Takeaways

* Work on building a catalog of experiences that you can pull from when needing to make decisions.
* Look at the successes AND failures of other people to see how their decisions affected their outcomes.
* Assign realistic probabilities to the outcomes, or paths, a decision might deliver.
* Continue to modify your decisions as you receive new information.

## Notes

The ability for us to make good decisions requires us to in large part *predict* the future. We need to be able to lay out what future paths will occur based on a decision that we make.

The Good Judgement Project (GJP) was formed to see if researchers could teach *normal people* (i.e., those not trained in probability and statistics) how to make better decisions and forecast events. They found that focusing the teaching on statistical techniques and tribalistic thinking, the people were able to increase their ability to correctly forecast events.

Bayesian psychology is that we can make decisions based on assumptions and then skewing those assumptions based on what we observe. To make these decisions, we must start with the right assumptions though and those assumptions are gathered largely through experiences. So therefore, the more you experience in life and then recall and use those experiences to make decisions, the better your decisions will be.

Duhigg notes that successful people focus on other peopleâ€™s failures which allows them to see what they did wrong so they can avoid it.
