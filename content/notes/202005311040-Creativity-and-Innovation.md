## Key Takeaways
  * Look at ways to solve a problem by pulling on domains outside of the direct domain
  * Use panic, frustration, and stress to your advantage by allowing them to help you solve problems
  * Disrupt the creative process just enough so that new ideas can flourish. 

## Notes
Creative people are generally not intellectual superstars. What they have the ability to do that others don’t, are to apply ideas from different areas and domains to the same problem that others were trying to solve. This was also noted as a central idea in David Epstein’s [Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range). The generalists were able to use experiences that they obtained in other domains to solve problems that others had tried to spend decades solving. 

Our emotional state also has a lot to do with how we solve problems. Duhigg notes that panic and frustration can cause us to place new ideas into old settings. He notes the invention of Cellophane due to a chemist looking at ways to prevent wine spills on table cloths or a chemical engineer who invented Post-it notes because he was tired of his bookmarks falling out of his bible.

A hypothesis in biology, called the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, can also be applied to creative thinking. The hypothesis states that if you disturb an ecosystem at just the right amount, that is, not too rare where nothing new can develop and not too frequently where only the hardest can survive, you will get a flourishing and diverse ecosystem. To apply this to creative thinking, if we can find away to prevent strong ideas from taking root and preventing us from seeing other options then we can find more creative ways to solve problems.

The chapter ends on three tenants to help increase the productivity of our own creative processes:

  1.	Pay attention to and reflect on our own experiences. Most creativity comes from what we have experienced as individuals.
  2.	Panic and stress are not bad signs per se, they enable us to remain flexible and look for new ways to solve problems.
  3.	Ensure you do not get blinded from seeing alternatives. Maintain distance and look into ways to disrupt the dynamic.
