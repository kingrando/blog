Welcome to my website. This is primarily intended for personal use but if any of the information I post on here helps someone else that's great.

## About Me

A little bit about me. My name is Kameron Ingrando and I'm currently a Senior Network Engineer in the DFW Area where I focus on Automation and NetDevOps. 

I have over 7 years of experience in the industry and have worked with a wide variety of technologies: 

```
{
   "Cisco":[
      "ASA",
      "Catalyst",
      "Firepower",
      "Identity Services Engine",
      "Meraki",
      "WLC"
   ],
   "Juniper":[
      "EX",
      "MX",
      "QFX"
   ],
   "Random":[
      "Ansible",
      "Ekahau",
      "Linux",
      "Python",
      "Wireshark"
   ]
}
```

Outside of networking, I've been exploring programming more, specfically web apps, and looking at monitoring, SRE, Docker, and whatever else I discover/feel like looking at.

## What is this site?

This site's foundantion is based on the note-taking methodology called Zettelkasten used by the [German sociologist Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann). Zettelkasten is a note-taking/knowledge management system that helps you to link notes together to form a web of information. Think of it like the neurons in your brain. Each neuron is connected to other neurons and so on. More information about Zettelkasten can be found [here](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/)

This site is broken down into 4 sections:

  * **Posts** - These are blog posts that I've written that more concisely written than my Zettels. These are focused almost exclusively on IT.
  * **Zettels** - These are the collection of Zettels, or notes, that act as a brain dump of information from things I read, watch, or think about. These have no focus and will be about books, videos, papers, or whatever.
  * **Tags** - This section is a list of tags used for connecting Zettels together. 
  * **Resources** - This is a curated list of content that I find interesting and I want to keep track of outside of the traditional bookmarking/web clipping systems.
